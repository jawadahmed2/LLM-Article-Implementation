{"text": "<s>[INST] Where do I find the QoS settings in SteelHead?\n[/INST]  To configure QoS on a SteelHead, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log into the SteelHead's management console.\n2. Navigate to \"Network > Network Services: Quality of Service.\"\n3. Enable QoS globally by selecting the checkbox next to the QoS feature you want to enable and clicking \"Save.\" You can enable outbound QoS marking without having to enable inbound or outbound QoS shaping.\n4. In the Manage QoS Per Interface section, enable QoS on the in-path interface.\n5. Configure QoS rules and profiles as needed. This includes creating rules based on specific applications, setting DSCP values, and defining classes for different types of traffic.\n6. Save your changes.\n\nFor more advanced configurations, such as serial cluster rules or OOB DSCP marking, additional steps may be required. Refer to the SteelHead documentation for more information on these features.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] Is there a difference between MX-TCP and TCP in terms of handling packet loss?\n[/INST]  Yes, there's a significant difference between MX-TCP and regular TCP in how they handle packet loss. MX-TCP is designed to maintain throughput rates even when the network has high packet loss rates. When traffic is accelerated with MX-TCP, the normal TCP congestion control mechanism is bypassed, and the outbound rate matches the minimum guaranteed bandwidth configured on the QoS class. This allows for efficient use of available bandwidth without experiencing a decrease in throughput typically seen with TCP when encountering packet loss.\n\nMX-TCP can be particularly useful in environments where there are high packet loss rates or long round-trip times, such as satellite connections or high-bandwidth, high-latency links, to ensure high throughput data transfer without requiring lower-layer error correction techniques like forward error correction (FEC).</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] Where do I find information about configuring SSL on SteelHead?\n[/INST]  To configure SSL on a SteelHead, you need to perform the following basic steps:\n\n1. Obtain valid Enhanced Cryptography License Keys for every SteelHead that peers with Client Accelerator and Client Accelerator.\n2. Configure the server-side SteelHead for SSL optimization with SSL servers.\n3. Create or edit the policy on the Client Accelerator to allow it to intercept SSL connections.\n4. Import the CA certificate from the Client Accelerator into the server-side SteelHead, and export the server-side SteelHead peering certificate.\n5. Add the server-side SteelHead peer to the Client Accelerator and establish mutual trust relationships between them.\n6. Replace the self-signed certificate with a trusted one for HTTPS access to the web UI of the appliance.\n7. Configure SSL proxy support in the policy on the Client Accelerator or using the CLI command `(config) # policy id <policy-id> ssl proxy-support enable`.\n8. Enable SSL optimization and client certificate support on the Client Accelerator.\n9. Run a test to verify your configuration.\n\nYou can refer to the Client Accelerator User Guide for detailed information about configuring SSL on SteelHeads. Additionally, you can find more information in the SteelHead Deployment Guide - Protocols, the SteelHead User Guide, and the Riverbed Command-Line Interface Reference Manual.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] Is there a requirement for a trust relationship between Client Accelerators for SSL configuration on SteelHead?\n[/INST]  Yes, for SSL configuration on SteelHead using Client Accelerators, there should be a trust relationship established between the Client Accelerators. Without this trust relationship, the Client Accelerator cannot connect to and provide the necessary configuration details to each other. The process involves exporting and importing certificates, as outlined in the provided context.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] Where is the configuration for enabling Connection Forwarding between SteelHeads in a cluster?\n[/INST]  To enable Connection Forwarding between SteelHeads in a cluster, you need to configure the in-path0\\_0 IP addresses of the two SteelHeads as neighbors. Here's an example:\n\nSteps for configuring Connection Forwarding between SteelHeads A and B:\n\n1. On SteelHead A:\n\n   a. Enable CLI access: `enable`\n   \n   b. Configure terminal: `configure terminal`\n   \n   c. Enable SteelHead communication: `SteelHead communication enable`\n   \n   d. Enable multi-interface forwarding: `SteelHead communication multi-interface enable`\n   \n   e. Configure SteelHead A's name and main IP address: `SteelHead name SteelHeadB main-ip 10.0.2.3`\n\n2. On SteelHead B:\n\n   a. Enable CLI access: `enable`\n   \n   b. Configure terminal: `configure terminal`\n   \n   c. Enable SteelHead communication: `SteelHead communication enable`\n   \n   d. Enable multi-interface forwarding: `SteelHead communication multi-interface enable`\n   \n   e. Configure SteelHead B's name and main IP address: `SteelHead name SteelHeadA main-ip 10.0.1.3`\n\nNow, both SteelHead A and B are configured to communicate with each other using their in-path interfaces (inpath0\\_0) as neighbors, enabling Connection Forwarding between them.</s>"}
{"text": "<s>[INST] Is there a difference between using multiple interfaces on the same SteelHead versus using multiple SteelHeads for ITD high availability deployment?\n[/INST]  Yes, there is a difference between using multiple interfaces on the same SteelHead versus using multiple SteelHeads for ITD high availability.\n\nUsing multiple interfaces on the same SteelHead with interface high availability allows you to increase acceleration throughput capacity and provide redundancy, as described in the \"Single SteelHead with interface high availability\" section on page 433 of your document. This configuration involves setting up multiple SteelHead interfaces to communicate with multiple routers, but it does not include any best practice recommendations on redirection and assignment method configurations.\n\nOn the other hand, using multiple SteelHeads for ITD high availability involves deploying two or more SteelHeads and configuring them to communicate with each other for handling asymmetry in traffic flows as described in the \"Dual SteelHeads and interfaces with high availability\" section on page 435 of your document. This design ensures that traffic can still be accelerated even if a network link, Nexus switch, SteelHead interface, or SteelHead fails.\n\nThe choice between these two options depends on your specific use case and network design requirements.</s>"}
