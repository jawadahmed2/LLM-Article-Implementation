{"text": "<s>[INST] Where do I find the QoS settings in SteelHead?\n[/INST]  To configure QoS on a SteelHead, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log into the SteelHead's management console.\n2. Navigate to \"Network > Network Services: Quality of Service.\"\n3. Enable QoS globally by selecting the checkbox next to the QoS feature you want to enable and clicking \"Save.\" You can enable outbound QoS marking without having to enable inbound or outbound QoS shaping.\n4. In the Manage QoS Per Interface section, enable QoS on the in-path interface.\n5. Configure QoS rules and profiles as needed. This includes creating rules based on specific applications, setting DSCP values, and defining classes for different types of traffic.\n6. Save your changes.\n\nFor more advanced configurations, such as serial cluster rules or OOB DSCP marking, additional steps may be required. Refer to the SteelHead documentation for more information on these features.</s>"}
